The vertical GRF of a rear-foot strike step typically has a distinct impact peak that would result in a high impact loading (Figure \ref{fig:c4_strike_rearfoot}). In contrast, the impact peak is not typically seen in a mid-foot or fore-foot strike step \cite{Cavanagh1980Ground}, and thus the corresponding impact loading would be smaller (Figure \ref{fig:c4_strike_forefoot}).


\subsection{Surgical Outcome Assessment}
Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery are common treatments for advanced knee OA patients. The surgical outcome is assessed by patient-reported measures and/or performance-based measures based on improvements in pains and functions \cite{blasco2020preferred}. Patient-reported measures are implemented through standard questionnaires, where a baseline measurement is established before the surgery and was compared with measurements acquired months after the surgery. Despite the convenience of patient-reported measures, their efficacy can be limited by many factors, including (1) floor/ceiling effects that may fail to distinguish patients with extreme outcomes \cite{na2012new, dowsey2013utility}, (2) pain dominance that masks the functional changes \cite{terwee2006self}, and (3) subjectivity that leads to inaccuracy and non-repeatability \cite{vaughn2019individual}. In contrast, performance-based measures tend to be more objective and have higher functional content validity \cite{boonstra2008quantify}, so it is often combined with patient-reported measures to enable comprehensive assessment. Performance-based measures are designed based on daily living activities such as 6-minute walk, timed-up-and-go, and stair climbing, which were traditionally performed inside of standard gait laboratories \cite{stevens2011comparison}. Since it is inconvenient for post-surgery patients to visit laboratories regularly, a home-based assessment approach might provide more accurate assessment results because it can restore real-life conditions and be performed on a more frequent basis.
